# Junda's dotfiles (forked from Mathias’s)

## Junda's Changes

### .osx

- Removed changes to: Computer name, Desktop configurations such as icon snap to grid, Notification bar, natural scroll, etc. Prefixed my comments with `JD:`


### .aliases

- Added `ws` for ~/Workspace


### .cask and Brewfile

- Disabled apps and brew install which I don't always use


## Junda's Instructions for setting up a new computer

#### 1. Install brew

```bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
```

#### 2. Install git

```bash
brew install git
```

#### 3. Download dotfiles

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/samwize/dotfiles && cd dotfiles
```

#### 4. Auto setup with dotfiles

Inspect these files first: {path,bash_prompt,exports,aliases,functions,extra} - it's your responsibility! Once confirm run:

```bash
source bootstrap.sh
```


#### 5. Run these too

```bash
# Sensible OS X defaults
./.osx
# Install more brew stuff
brew bundle ~/Brewfile
# Install apps
cask
```

#### 6. Oh-my-zsh

Setup [samwize's oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/samwize/oh-my-zsh).

```bash
git clone git://github.com/samwize/oh-my-zsh.git ~/.oh-my-zsh
cd ~
cp ~/.oh-my-zsh/templates/zshrc.zsh-template ~/.zshrc
chsh -s /bin/zsh
```

Done! Enjoy your new computer, that feels like old!

## Installation

### Using Git and the bootstrap script

You can clone the repository wherever you want. (I like to keep it in `~/Projects/dotfiles`, with `~/dotfiles` as a symlink.) The bootstrapper script will pull in the latest version and copy the files to your home folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && source bootstrap.sh
```

To update, `cd` into your local `dotfiles` repository and then:

```bash
source bootstrap.sh
```

Alternatively, to update while avoiding the confirmation prompt:

```bash
set -- -f; source bootstrap.sh
```

### Git-free install

To install these dotfiles without Git:

```bash
cd; curl -#L https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/tarball/master | tar -xzv --strip-components 1 --exclude={README.md,bootstrap.sh,LICENSE-MIT.txt}
```

To update later on, just run that command again.

### Specify the `$PATH`

If `~/.path` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files, before any feature testing (such as [detecting which version of `ls` is being used](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/aff769fd75225d8f2e481185a71d5e05b76002dc/.aliases#L21-26)) takes place.

Here’s an example `~/.path` file that adds `~/utils` to the `$PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/utils:$PATH"
```

### Add custom commands without creating a new fork

If `~/.extra` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files. You can use this to add a few custom commands without the need to fork this entire repository, or to add commands you don’t want to commit to a public repository.

My `~/.extra` looks something like this:

```bash
# Git credentials
# Not in the repository, to prevent people from accidentally committing under my name
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Mathias Bynens"
GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
git config --global user.name "$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="mathias@mailinator.com"
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
git config --global user.email "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
```

You could also use `~/.extra` to override settings, functions and aliases from my dotfiles repository. It’s probably better to [fork this repository](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/fork) instead, though.

### Sensible OS X defaults

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible OS X defaults:

```bash
./.osx
```

### Install Homebrew formulae

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to install some common [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) formulae (after installing Homebrew, of course):

```bash
brew bundle ~/Brewfile
```

### Install native apps with `brew cask`

You could also install native apps with [`brew cask`](https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask):

```bash
./.cask
```
